# Reaction Time Game

### Description

Welcome to my project. My goal was to create a simple game written in C to test your reaction time. Goal is to press shown keys ASAP. User can choose from several difficulty levels and free mode with best times stored in a simple record.txt file. In a “Free mode” user can endlessly train to improve his time. Entire program was written in C language and is compatible only with Windows users.

### Technologies

Project is created with:
* C programming language: C11 standard
* windows.h and conio.h libraries

### Launch

Project contains .exe file, which can be downloaded and played immediately. If the program cannot find the record.txt file to store best results, it creates one in directory with .exe file. You can as well download my best times, the source code and header file.
